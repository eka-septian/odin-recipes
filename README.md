My first web project!

In this project, I am actually just applying what I've learned from the Odin Project HTML foundations course. I really like how the outcome is coming out and, yes, I had a lot of fun working on this project even though it's just a simple HTML page. I was messing around a bit with CSS and I hope I can keep going on this journey of web development.
